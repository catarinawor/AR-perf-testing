# Instructions for installing the correct version of ss3sim
You will need to install a new version of ss3sim in order to properly run the code that produces the plots and output files.  To do this, use 

  devtools::install.github("ss3sim/ss3sim","master")

in R GUI.  Note that this will overwrite the current install of ss3sim, so you should move any user-generated files stored in the ss3sim library folder to another location before reinstalling ss3sim.

You will need to download two files located here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zg0sec6j20sfyyz/AACQiuk787qW882U2euVKoPna

You will also need to change your file path.  To do this, consult the vignette for ss3sim available here: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ss3sim/vignettes/ss3sim-vignette.pdf

You should be able to run the code files at this point.  If you have any difficulty doing so, please let me, Elizabeth, or Kelli know.
