Choice of software package:

ss3sim provides simple and straightforward means to produce replicates of data needed for project
code created to run ss3sim directly from R. It also works with plotting tools from r4ss package.

Methods - outlined process

1	Set number of forecast years and autocorrelated recruitment (AR) levels. Forecast years = 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 20 years.  AR = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9

2	Produce matrix of recruitment deviations using bias-corrected method from Thorson and Kristensen and fixed seed in R.
	
3	Pass recruitment deviations to ss3sim.  Default is 100 replicates for each combination of forecast years and AR, and 20 bias adjustment runs.

4	Run ss3sim which passes the input data into ss3 and exports results back into a separate output folder in ss3sim library.  The run section does two runs for each combination: one with bias adjustment on and one with no bias adjustment.  We are using this output to compare how these two scenarios (no bias vs bias) affect results (specifically B/Bmsy and F/Fmsy).

5	Reformat output data using get_results_all from ss3sim.  This creates two master csv files per level of AR and bias adjust toggle (on or off).  The first is a file with all the parameters used for the simulations.  The second is a master output file with all output data for a set level of AR concatenated into a vertical matrix organized by replicate number and forecast scenario.  This reorganization allows for easy transfer of raw data to r4ss plotting packages as well as plotting tools in ss3sim.

6 	Plot output data.  Initially, we looking at SSB, but I would also like to look at R0, B/Bmsy and F/Fmsy as well.
	
	Initial target plots (repeated for other metrics we wish to examine)
	
	A: Time series projections of SSB for each AR value and forecast value
	B: Relative error in predictions of SSB
	C: Relative error in estimates of R0 across values of AR
	D: Plot showing precision in estimates of SSB with replication
